3. Bundler :- A bundler is a development tool that combines many JavaScript code files into a
single one that is production-ready loadable in the browser. A fantastic feature of a bundler is 
that it generates a dependency graph as it traverses your first code files.

(webpack, Parcel, vite)

create-react-app : use the webpack bundler to create a react app 

a. webpack-bundler : entery , output , module , plugins

c. Parcel : Parcel. js is an open-source bundler. It supports many popular languages like 
Typescript and SASS, and can also handle file types like images and fonts. Parcel comes with 
a few extra tools built-in: a development server, diagnostics, minification, and even image 
compression.

npm install -D parcel ( -D denotes the dev dependencies)

b. Vite :- Vite is a faster and lighter dev server and bundler than Webpack, specifically designed 
for modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue and React. Vite takes advantage of ES modules in the 
browser to create a feedback loop that allows for faster development and hot reloading.


4. Dependency : When we install the app then we have two dependencies which will prompt to us
for any app we install 

a. Normal Dependency : It requires in dev and in production environments both for running the
application.
b. Dev Dependency : It generally requires only when we develop the app.
